## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Final project about Tourism in Aarhus and comparing with the region of Region Midtjylland 


- Please start by cloning the necessary files in the repository at; <https://github.com/IdaMarieByskov/Final_Project_Ida_Laura>
- Place them at your Desktop in order to use this code. 

#### Using this line to get a closer behaviour from the command line as from the RStudio environment in terms of package downloads. This is in order to make the Knit work. 
```{r}
options(repos = list(CRAN="http://cran.rstudio.com/"))
```

#### Install Packages 
```{r PackagesInstall, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("gganimate")
install.packages("gifski")
install.packages("av")
install.packages("gapminder")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("data.table")
```

#### View Packages 
```{r Packages, echo=FALSE}
#View packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(av)
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(data.table)
```

### Load Data Aarhus  
```{r Aarhus, echo=TRUE}
#load the excel sheet 
library(readxl)
Tourism_Aarhus <- read_excel("~/Desktop/Aarhus.xlsx")

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus)
```

### Renaming the column headers 

```{r}
# Rename to column headers
Tourism_Aarhus <- Tourism_Aarhus %>% 
  rename(
    Accommodation = ...1,
    Months = ...2  
  )

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus)
```

### Adding values in all rows in the accommodation column and translateing names to English
```{r}
# add values in all rows in the accommodation column make it English names 
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [1:12] <- "Hotels"
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [13:24] <- "Vacationcenter"
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [25:36] <- "Camping"
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [37:48] <- "Hostel"
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [49:60] <- "Marinas"
Tourism_Aarhus$Accommodation [61:72] <- "HolidayHouses"

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus)
```

### Replace the missing values across the DataFrame with NA
```{r}
# Replace the missing values across the DataFrame with NA 
Tourism_Aarhus[Tourism_Aarhus == ".."] <- NA

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus)
```


### Convering the colunms 2017 to 2021 into year, by using the 'gather' function.
```{r}
#Convering the colunms 2017 to 2021 into year. 
Tourism_Aarhus_gathered <- Tourism_Aarhus %>% 
  gather(Year, Nights, "2017":"2021")

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered)
```

### Delete vacationcenters as they are calculated as a total with hotels in the raw dataset
```{r}
#Delete vacationcenters  
Tourism_Aarhus_gathered <- Tourism_Aarhus_gathered[!(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Accommodation=="Vacationcenter"),]

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered)
```

### Renaming 'Hotels' to 'Hotels and Vacationscenters' as these are calculated together in the raw data
```{r}
# Rename Hotels to Hotels and Vacationscenters
Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Accommodation[Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Accommodation == "Hotels"] <- "Hotels and Vacationcenters"

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered)
```

### Delete months which is not part of the summer period  
- We would only like to look at may, june, july, august and september. 
```{r}
#Delete months which is not part of the summer period  
Tourism_Aarhus_gathered <- Tourism_Aarhus_gathered[!(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="Januar" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="Februar" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="Marts" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="April" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="Oktober" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="November" | Tourism_Aarhus_gathered$Months=="December"),]

#view Data 
View(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered)
```

### Saving the data in a CSV file 
We have to save it as a CSV file, as the the online visualization program are not able to process XLSX spreadsheets. 
```{r}
#Save the dataframe on desktop as CSV file 
write.csv(Tourism_Aarhus_gathered, "~/Desktop/Aarhus.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
